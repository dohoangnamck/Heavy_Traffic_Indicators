## Heavy_Traffic_Indicators - Data Visualization

In this project, we're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94
Interstate highway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94) connecting the Great Lakes and
northern Great Plains regions of the U.S. The dataset was made available by John Hogue and
can be downloaded from this repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94, such as
weather type, day of the week, hour, etc.
